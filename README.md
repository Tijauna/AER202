# AER202

AER202 is a tool that uses machine learning to automatically identify planes 
from a photo. The goal is to assist plane-spotters by identifying subtle 
airplane characteristics that might be otherwise difficult to spot by eye. 
Applying neural networks to this problem could greatly increase the 
identification accuracy and speed.
